2 Player Snake!

My second Ruby project ever!

To check it out, you can either:

	1. Download the zip (contains the pngs and the script), then -gem install gosu, then run it
	
					 OR
	
	2. Download the .exe (if you're using Windows)
	

Controls are w-a-s-d and the arrow keys. You can safely run into walls and into the other snake, but not into yourself. First to 15 wins.





Hope you like it!
